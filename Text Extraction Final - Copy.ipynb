This paper presents a software system called WebMonitoring. \\nThe system is designed for solving certain problems in the process of \\ninformation search on the web. The first problem is improving entering of \\nqueries at search engines and enabling more complex searches than \\nkeyword-based ones. The second problem is providing access to web \\npage content that is inaccessible by common search engines due to \\nsearch engine’s crawling limitations or time difference between the \\nmoment a web page is set up on the Internet and the moment the \\ncrawler finds it. The architecture of the WebMonitoring system relies \\nupon finite state machines and the concept of monitoring the web. We \\npresent the system’s architecture and usage. Some modules were \\noriginally developed for the purpose of the WebMonitoring system, and \\nsome rely on UNITEX, linguistically oriented software system. We \\nhereby evaluate the WebMonitoring system and give directions for \\nfurther development. \\nKeywords: finite state automata, finite state transducers, software, web \\nmonitoring, electronic dictionaries, web search \\n1. \\nIntroduction \\nThe problem of effective search for some particular piece of information is \\nquite current, because of the tremendous amount of information available on \\nthe World Wide Web. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational \\nLinguistics (CL) play a dominant role in attempts to solve this problem. \\nDepending on the structure of an electronic text, properties of the language it \\nis written in, and user requirements, NLP and CL have different levels of \\nsuccess. Although very fast and powerful search engines already exist, there \\nare still problems that remain unsolved. In our research, we focused on the \\ntwo of them. \\nFirst, there is a problem of “invisible web” [1], i.e., not having access to \\nsome content on the web through search engines. Almost every modern \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n2 \\nsearch system (Google1, Yahoo2 etc.) consists of several sub-systems, the \\nmost important being the sub-systems for crawling, indexing, and ranking web \\npages. Since search systems are faced with a huge number of web pages to \\ndownload and process, each subsystem imposes certain limitations. For the \\nsearch engine’s crawler to find a web page, it is necessary either that the web \\ndeveloper has notified the system of its existence on the web by registering \\nthe page URL to the search engine, or that the crawler has visited some other \\nweb page containing the hyperlink that points to it. Otherwise, the page \\nremains \"invisible\" to the search system, and therefore to users. In addition, \\ngiven that resources of every search system are limited, each crawler has \\ncertain limitations that keep crawling process within the limits of available \\nresources. Some search engines limit the total number of pages in the index \\nand drop the old pages when there are new ones, while others limit the \\nfrequency of repeated visits to pages. Whenever the search engine decides to \\nlimit the search process, the part of the information remains unavailable to \\nusers. \\nThere is also a time difference between the moment some content is \\nuploaded to the web and the moment the crawler finds it. This is a major \\nproblem for pages that frequently change their content, such as daily news or \\ndifferent forums. Some search engines, including Google, allow the author of \\na website to reduce this interval, i.e. to increase the frequency at which the \\ncrawler visits the site in order to better respond to customer requirements.  \\nAnother way of overcoming the problem of dynamic content is the concept of \\nRSS (“Really Simple Syndication\"), which implies that the author of a \\nparticular web site edits and maintains a list of changes on the web site. This \\nlist is called “RSS feed”. Customers interested in following the changes on the \\nweb site can access this list automatically by using a special program known \\nas RSS aggregator. In either case, the visibility of the content depends on the \\nwebsite author. If the author has not provided an RSS feed, nor reduced the \\ninterval of the crawler’s visits to the page, the users can do no more but \\npersonally and regularly check the contents of a particular website in \\nsearching for specific information. \\nThe second problem is the way search engines queries are composed, \\nwhich is often not adequate. Regardless of the facts that Internet users come \\nfrom different countries, have different areas of interest and levels of \\neducation, speak different languages, and have different needs for \\ninformation, they are all facing the same or similar forms when querying \\nsearch engines. Mostly, it is a HTML form for keyword search, sometimes with \\nadvanced options that allow users to further limit their search. There is no way \\nfor a user to formulate some more complex queries. \\nThis problem is even more evident in case of morphologically rich \\nlanguages, such as Serbian language. For example, if users want to find web \\npages about Serbian national football team, they would be interested in \\ndocuments that contain some of the phrases: \\n                                                   \\n1 http://www.google.com \\n2 http://www.yahoo.com \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n3 \\nreprezentacija Srbije („national team of Serbia”); \\nnaša reprezentacija („our national team”); \\nreprezentativci Srbije („football players of national team of Serbia”); \\nfudbaleri Srbije („football players of Serbia”); \\ntim „orlova“ („eagles” team); \\nnaš nacionalni tim (“our national team”); \\ntim Radomira Antića (“Radomir Antic’s team”); \\nsrpski fudbaleri (“Serbian football players”); \\nsrpska ekipa (“Serbian team”); \\nsrpska reprezentacija (“Serbian national team”). \\nEven more, the documents containing any of the inflectional forms of the \\nabove phrases are also relevant for the user. General-purpose search \\nengines do not allow making such queries. In recent years, Google has made \\nsignificant efforts to improve its search process and to bring it to customers, \\nso it returns results where keywords appear in inflected forms as well. This is \\na good attempt to improve search, but the big problem is that users have no \\ncontrol over this process. \\nIn our research, we focused on solving the above-mentioned problems: \\nimproving the way of formulating queries, which will allow for describing more \\ncomplex context of information, and enabling the access to the content on the \\nWeb in the shortest possible time interval. The proposed solution uses finite \\nstate automata as search queries, which allows users to describe very \\ncomplex contexts and phrases they wish to find on web pages. We overcame \\nthe second problem by designing a special system that supports the concept \\nof monitoring the web, over which the user has full control. As a result, we \\nhave developed the software system called WebMonitoring, which works as a \\nclient application on a user’s computer. It has its own crawling sub-system \\nthat allows a user to set a seed URL and a depth level of crawling, and \\ntherefore to monitor one page, one part of a web site or the whole web site. \\nUsers describe information they want to find by graphs representing finite \\nstate automata or transducers. Those graphs are used as a query for the \\nsearch. Users can set the way they wish to be alarmed if some information \\noccurs on the monitored web page, as well as the interval of repeated checks.  \\n2. \\nState of the Art in Monitoring the Web \\nIn attempts to improve the process of searching for information on the WWW, \\ndifferent tools for searching and monitoring the web have been developed. \\nDepending on their architecture and functionality, as well as the problems \\nthey focus on, they can be divided into two groups. \\nThe tools in the first group focus on monitoring the web. They are all \\ndesigned primarily for notification if a web page has been changed; there is no \\npossibility to search for some complex queries, except queries based on \\nkeywords using Boolean operators. A user can set the frequency of \\ndownloads, but it is often limited to some minimum interval (in most cases it is \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n4 \\n12 hours interval). Changes occurring on the page in less than 12 hours may \\nnot be noticed by the system. Some of the tools use regular expressions, but \\nonly to restrict the monitored web page content. Examples of such tools are \\nonline systems ChangeDetect3 and WebSite Watcher4. \\n The ChangeDetect system is an online tool for monitoring web pages. For \\neach page a user wants to monitor it is possible to set several parameters: \\nfrequency of downloads, regular expression filtering, events causing alerting \\nthe user and so on. Still, the minimum monitoring interval is 12 hours. \\nChanges occurring on the page in less than 12 hours may not be noticed by \\nthe system. Moreover, the system is designed primarily for notification if a \\nweb page has been changed. There is no possibility to search for complex \\nqueries, nor the possibility to monitor the entire site. While a user can assign \\nmultiple pages to be monitored in the control panel, the monitoring system \\nmonitors only the pages with listed URL within each process. \\nWebSite-Watcher is the software designed to track changes on any \\nnumber of web pages. With this tool it is possible to monitor all formats of \\nelectronic text, including even password-protected pages. Moreover, this tool \\nallows a user to monitor changes of binary files in the sense of changing the \\nsize or the date the file was changed. However, even this tool does not \\nsupport setting up complex queries. WebSite-Watcher uses regular \\nexpressions, but only to restrict the monitored web page content. A user is \\nenabled only to search for the occurrence of a keyword or a phrase. \\nThe second group of available tools contains tools that focus on making \\nqueries for the search. They are often linguistically oriented, and one of the \\nbest known is WebCorp system [2]. WebCorp is a software tool designed by \\nthe Department of Research and Development of English Language at the \\nUniversity of Birmingham. It is intended primarily for linguistic research, but it \\ncan be used for search as well. A user is allowed to search for a specific \\nword, a phrase, or a pattern. Patterns can be formed by combining the \\noperator *, which replaces any sequence of characters in an expression, \\nsquare brackets and the OR operator. Although this tool represents a \\nsignificant improvement since it allows describing complex phrases or \\npatterns, it still does not solve the problem since it relies upon results from the \\nexisting search engines. Therefore, there is still much information on the web \\nthat remains inaccessible by this tool. \\nA free online concordance service, GlossaNet [3], is a software tool that \\nsolves many of the problems related to information search on the web. It is \\nintended for search into dynamic Web corpora. Users define a corpus by \\nselecting RSS feeds in a pre-selected pool of sources. The GlossaNet crawler \\nregularly visits these sources in order to generate a dynamic corpus. A user \\ncan register one or more search queries on his/her dynamic corpus, which are \\nrepresented with finite state automata and graphs. Those queries will be \\nreapplied to the corpus every time it is updated and new concordances will be \\nrecorded for the user. The GlossaNet greatly improves the process of search, \\n                                                   \\n3 http://www.changedetect.com \\n4 http://www.aignes.com \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n5 \\nbut its main disadvantage is the way it makes corpora. The GlossaNet relies \\nupon RSS feed, and therefore upon a web site’s owner and his/her decision \\nabout what is to be updated. If the owner of a web site does not provide \\ninformation about some change in page content, the user will not be able to \\naccess that information. \\n3. \\nWebMonitoring Software System \\n1.1. \\nTheoretical Background \\nFinite State Machines in NLP. Finite state machines (automata and \\ntransducers) are used in many fields of computational linguistics. Their use is \\njustified from the standpoint of linguistics, as well as from the standpoint of \\ncomputer science. From the linguistics point of view, finite state machines are \\nadequate for describing relevant local phenomena in language research and \\nfor modeling some parts of natural language, such as its phonology, \\nmorphology, or syntax. Some examples of adequate representation of \\ndifferent linguistics phenomena by finite state machines are given in [4]. From \\ncomputer science point of view, the use of finite state machines is motivated \\nby time and space efficiency. Time efficiency is achieved by using \\ndeterministic finite state machines. The output of the deterministic machines \\ndepends mostly on the size of the input, so they are considered to be optimal \\n([5] and [6]). Space efficiency is achieved by minimizing deterministic \\nmachines [7]. \\nFinite state machines can be very complex and difficult to maintain, which \\nleads to some problems in practice. For example, if someone tries to describe \\nthe language syntax by finite state machine, the corresponding graph would \\nbe very immense, and finding some particular information, such as noun \\nphrases, would be time consuming and impractical. So, instead of one big \\ngraph, we use a collection of sub graphs. This method has a strong \\ntheoretical background in the theory of Recursive Transition Networks (RTN). \\nRTN are extension of context free grammars ([8] and [9]). The arcs in RTN \\nare labeled with corresponding grammars, while the states are labeled \\narbitrarily. There are several computer tools for linguistic research based on \\nFSM and RTN ([10], [11] and [12]). Detailed review of theoretical and practical \\nuse of finite state transducers in natural language processing is given in [13], \\n[14], [15], [16], [17] and [18]. \\nThe Concept of Monitoring the Web. The concept of web monitoring has \\nemerged from the need for automating certain actions taken by user in order \\nto be notified of changes that occur on a particular web page or site. In \\npractice, there are often situations when a user visits a web site expecting that \\nsome event occurred on it, without being interested in the rest of the content \\nof the web site. Examples of such events are announcement of the results of \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n6 \\nsome competition, electronic message with the specific content or from a \\nspecific person, the appearance of news about a particular topic, and so on. \\nIn such cases, the user regularly, with the schedule that he or she believes is \\noptimal or possible at a time, visits the web site of interest looking for the \\nevent. The software for web monitoring automates this searching process and \\nsimulates the actions that the human would take. \\n1.2. \\nArchitecture of the WebMonitoring System \\nThe WebMonitoring software system is developed in the order to overcome \\nproblems in search process defined in the Section 1. It is written in the Java \\nprogramming language and consists of several sub-systems: \\n- the system for making queries – it is based on the Unitex [11] software \\nsystem \\n- the management system \\n- the crawler \\n- the system for text post-processing \\n- the alarming system \\n- the graphical user interface \\nThe description of the software architecture is given in Figure 1. \\n \\nFig 1. Architecture of the WebMonitoring system \\nThe management system, the crawler, the alarming system and the \\ngraphical user interface were developed and written by the authors for the \\npurpose of the WebMonitoring system, while we used the Unitex software and \\nsome of its components for querying and post-processing the text. \\n A user creates a graph that describes an event of interest using the Unitex \\nsystem. This graph is passed as an input to the management system. Using \\nthe graphical user interface of the WebMonitoring software system, the user \\nWebMonitoring \\nUnitex \\nGraph editor \\nquery.f\\nst2 \\nThe system for post-\\nprocessing \\nThe management \\nsystem \\nDownloading page 1 \\nDownloading page 2 \\nDownloading page n \\nThe \\nalarming \\nsystem \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n7 \\nsets the URL of the page or website which is being monitored, adjusts \\nparameters, such as dynamics of the visits, the depth of the crawl process \\n(relative to the page from which the crawl will start), the way of alarming, and \\nso on. After that, the management system runs one separate programming \\nthread for each monitoring process set in the management system. The web \\npages found in the crawling process are saved locally. The system for post-\\nprocessing analyzes and processes these pages, and tries to find patterns \\ncorresponding to the graph. When a pattern is found (and event occurred), the \\nsystem notifies the user. \\nThe System for Making Queries. The WebMonitoring system uses graphs \\nproduced by the Unitex software system [11] as search queries. Unitex is a \\ncollection of programs developed for analyzing text written in natural \\nlanguages, and for applying different linguistic resources and tools to the text. \\nIt is an open source software with a very good, functional, and user-friendly \\ngraphical interface. Apart from its well-designed graphical user interface for \\ncreating graphs, one of the main advantages of the Unitex software is the \\npossibility to use linguistic resources, such as electronic dictionaries and \\ngrammars. \\nElectronic dictionaries contain simple and compound words, together with \\ntheir lemmas and the set of grammatical codes. They are constructed by \\nteams of linguists for different languages (for English language [19] and [20], \\nfor French language [21] and [22], for Serbian language [23] and [24]). Unitex \\nuses electronic dictionaries in DELA format, where each entry is a line of text \\nterminated by a new line, which conforms to the following syntax: \\napples,apple.N+conc:p \\nThe first word (apples) is an inflected form of the entry and it is \\nmandatory. In the former example it is followed by the canonical form (lemma) \\nof the entry. This information may be left out if the canonical form is the same \\nas the inflected form. The following sequence of codes (N+conc) gives the \\ngrammatical and semantic information about the entry. In the former example, \\ncode N stands for noun, and conc indicates that this noun designates a \\nconcrete object. The label p stands for “plural”. \\nAlthough Unitex can process text in different languages, in the first version \\nof the WebMonitoring software it is assumed that Serbian language will be \\nused. For that reason electronic dictionaries for Serbian language are used \\n([23] and [24]) in the WebMonitoring modules for post-processing the text. \\nAfter applying dictionaries and grammars to the text, Unitex creates \\nseparate files with simple words, compound words, and unrecognized words. \\nThose files are used in the search process, so one can refer to the dictionary \\nentry from the Unitex by using lexical masks. For example, a user can use the \\nquery <be.V> that matches all entries having be as canonical form and the \\ngrammatical code V. Thus all occurrences of the verb to be (am, is, being etc.) \\nwill be recognized by this query. Beside lexical masks, a user can use \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n8 \\nmorphological filters. For example, the filter <<ism$>> matches all words that \\nend with “ism” (conservatism, racism, etc.). \\nBy applying lexical resources to the text, as well as combining lexical \\nmasks and morphological filters, users can make graphs that correspond to \\nvery complex queries. Those graphs in Unitex may have two formats, the \\nformat .grf, which is intended for the design phase of graphs, and the \\nformat .fst2, which is compiled version of graphs, intended for further \\nprocessing and applying to a text. \\nThe graph that corresponds to the phrases about the Serbian national team \\ndescribed in the Section 1 is shown in the Figure 2. \\n \\nFig. 2. (a) RTN for describing the phrases corresponding to the Serbian national team; \\nit contains calls to sub-graphs orloviPost and orloviPre; (b) orloviPost is a sub-graph \\nfor describing the terms in which the affiliation is given after the noun; (c) orloviPre is a \\nsub-graph for describing the terms in which the affiliation is given before the noun \\nThe content of the corresponding .fst2 file, which is used as a search \\nquery, is as follows: \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n9 \\n0000000003 \\n-1 orlovi \\n: -2 1 -3 1 1 1  \\nt  \\nf  \\n-2 orloviPre \\n: 9 2 8 1 6 1  \\n: 5 3 4 3 3 3 2 3  \\n: 7 4 5 3 4 3 3 3 2 3  \\nt  \\n: 5 3 4 3  \\nf  \\n-3 orloviPost \\n: 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1  \\n: 11 3 10 2  \\nt  \\n: 12 2  \\nf  \\n%<E> \\n%<<^orlov>> \\n%<<^reprezenta>> \\n%<<^fudbaler>> \\n%<<^tim>> \\n%<<^ekip>> \\n%<<^srpsk>> \\n%<<^nacionaln>> \\n%<<^Antićev>> \\n%<<^naš>> \\n%<<^Srbij>> \\n%<<^Radomir>> \\n%<<^Antić>> \\nf \\nThe .fst2 format is strictly defined by the Unitex software.  The first line \\nrepresents the number of graphs that are encoded in the file. Lines containing \\nthe number and the name of the graph identify the beginning of each sub-\\ngraph. In the above file, those are the lines -1 orlovi, -2 orloviPre and \\n-3 orloviPost. The following lines describe the states of the graph. If the \\nstate is final, the line starts with t character, and with : character if not.  \\nFor each state, the list of transitions is a sequence of pairs of integers. The \\nfirst integer indicates the number of the label or sub-graph that corresponds to \\nthe transition. Labels are numbered starting from 0. Sub-graphs are \\nrepresented by negative integers. The second integer represents the number \\nof the result state after the transition. In each graph the states are numbered \\nstarting with 0. By convention, state 0 is the initial state. \\nFrom the standpoint of the WebMonitoring users, the Unitex system and its \\ninterface for creating graphs represent a system for making queries, i.e. for \\ndescribing an event a user wants to be notified of. Using the Unitex system, a \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n10 \\nuser creates a graph that describes the event of interest, and then compiles it \\ninto the .fst2 format. This file contains all the necessary information about \\nthe event of interest and, as such, it represents the input data for the \\nWebMonitoring system. \\nThe Management System. The management system of the WebMonitoring \\nsoftware consists of several Java classes, and it represents the central point \\nof the overall system. It is designed so as to enable a user to run more than \\none independent monitoring process. \\nEvery monitoring process is defined by the following attributes: \\n- URL – a web page URL from which the crawl and the search start; \\n- graph – a location of .fst2 file which describes the searched phrases; \\n- levels – an integer that defines the depth of crawl; this attribute is explained \\nin more details later; \\n- alarm – a string attribute that defines the way a user should be alarmed if \\nthe event occurred. There are two possibilities: sending an e-mail message \\nand saving the page on the local hard disk. This attribute has the following \\nform: address; location, where address is an e-mail address for \\nsending the message, and location is a directory path for saving the \\npage. If any of these parts of the alarm attribute equals null, there will be no \\nalarming of that kind; \\n- timeInterval – an integer that represents a time interval (in milliseconds) \\nbetween two repeated search processes. \\n \\nThere is an instance of the class MonitoringProcess for every monitoring \\nprocess in the programming code. The class MonitoringProcess extends the \\nThread class in Java, i.e. it is a runnable thread. In that way the independent \\nand parallel monitoring of different pages and searching for different queries \\nare allowed.  \\nWhen the application is started, the main window of the management \\nsystem will open (Figure 3). It will show the monitoring processes that were \\nstarted during the previous run in the table, if any. A user can select some \\nprocess from the table to view or change its characteristics. From this window \\nthe user can also delete, make a new, start or stop a process. \\nThe Crawler. After the user has started a monitoring process, the crawler \\nstarts a crawl from the URL that is set in the process properties. The crawling \\nprocess depends on the value of the levels parameter. If the value of the \\nparameter is 1, the system should take only this page. \\nOtherwise, when one page is downloaded from the Internet, it is analyzed \\nto find other hyperlinks on it. The system stores found hyperlinks in the crawl \\nqueue and sends them back to the crawler, with the crawling level decreased \\nby one. The crawl process is stopped when all the pages with the level \\ngreater than 0 have been processed. \\n \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n11 \\n \\nFig. 3. The control center of the management system \\nThe crawler of the WebMonitoring system is designed to satisfy the \\nfollowing basic principles of a good crawler [25]: \\n- efficiency - a number of hyperlinks a crawler needs to process increases \\nexponentially with the number of visited pages increasing, so the system \\nmust be able to handle the list of addresses in efficient manner from the \\npoint of memory usage; \\n- duplicates – the crawler needs to add to the address list only those \\naddresses that have not been visited, i.e. to recognize the addresses of \\npages that have already been processed and not to add them to the list; \\n- politeness – the crawler must comply with the directives contained in the \\nrobots.txt file on the web server, and to avoid downloading too many pages \\nfrom a website, so its functionality should not be threatened; \\n- avoiding the traps - crawler must be able to recognize and avoid sites that \\nare created with the intent to cause an infinite loop for crawlers visiting \\nthem. \\nThe crawling sub-system consists of several classes, all belonging to the \\npackage crawler.driller: \\n- class _GO_PARAMS keeps all the important parameters for the crawling \\nprocess, such as the seed URL, the number of levels for crawling, the array \\nof the web addresses from the starting page to the current one, etc.; \\n- class DrillingQueue defines a dynamic data structure for keeping the queue \\nof web URL\\'s which have to be downloaded and processed; \\n- class PathFinder keeps information about the path crawler used to get \\nsome page; \\n- class Driller starts downloading pages from the seed URL, regarding the \\nnumber of levels (the levels parameter). \\nThe starting class of the crawling sub system is the CrawlerShell class, \\nwhich performs all the necessary adjustments of parameters and runs the \\ncrawler. There are many parameters within this class intended for configuring \\nthe system for downloading pages. For the purpose of the WebMonitoring \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n12 \\nsystem, some of these parameters have default values that cannot be \\nchanged by the user. Thus, for example, the value of the parameter timeout is \\n60 seconds, which means that the crawler sub system will wait for up to one \\nminute for downloading a page from the Internet. Similarly, the maximum time \\nto download pages from one site (in a monitoring process) is defined by the \\nmaxTimeout parameter, and it is set to 20 minutes (1200 seconds). The \\ndeclaration section of the CrawlerShell class is shown in the following code: \\n/** Class for downloading pages starting from the \\nseed URL */ \\npublic class CrawlerShell{ \\n \\n// default argument values \\n  static String hunt = null; \\n  public static boolean thisSiteOnly = false, silent \\n= false; \\n  public static int maxTimeout = 1200, timeout = 60; \\n  public static int maxlinks = 1000, maxretries = 3; \\n  public static int levels = 0, sleepParamMS = 500; \\n  static boolean analyze = true, passedAskMe = false; \\n  static boolean flash = false, displayLinks = true; \\n  static magicPath = false; \\n  static long timeStart = System.currentTimeMillis(); \\n  static boolean logHttp = false, hideUrls = true; \\n  ...... \\nAfter adjusting the parameters, the crawler for the given URL is started. \\nThe text found on every web page in this process is sent to the post-\\nprocessing system for further analysis, i.e. for the graph search. \\nThe System for Text Post-processing and Alarming. When a web page is \\ndownloaded from the Internet, first it is necessary to prepare the text it \\ncontains, and then to search for the appropriate event defined by the search \\ngraph. This task is performed by the system for post-processing and its class \\nMonitoredText. Since the Unitex’s external program Locate has the central \\nplace in the search process, the text from the page is prepared in accordance \\nwith the requirements of this program. \\nThe text found on the web page is saved in a text file and stored in a \\ntemporary directory. This file is the starting file in the text processing. \\nAlthough text on web pages is coded differently, most websites in Serbian \\nlanguage nowadays use UTF-8 encoding.  UTF-8 (8 bit Unicode \\nTransformation Format) encodes each Unicode character as a variable \\nnumber of 1 to 4 octets, where the number of octets depends on the integer \\nvalue assigned to the Unicode character. Since each character in the range of \\nU+0000 through U+007F is represented as a single octet, UTF-8 is a very \\nefficient encoding schema of text documents in which most characters are \\nUS-ASCII. This is also the reason why this encoding became dominant for \\nelectronic mail and web documents, and therefore WebMonitoring system \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n13 \\nassumes that the page is encoded in UTF-8. The text found on the page is \\nsaved in a text file using methods from the class  fr.umlv.unitex.io.UnicodeIO. \\nThis class is specially designed for the Unitex system purposes, so every file \\nmade during the post-processing can be read and processed adequately.   \\nThe first step in the post-processing is normalization of the text. \\nNormalization is a process in which the normalization of separators of the text \\nis made, although it is possible to normalize the text on the basis of some \\nother specific rule. Separators in a text are space characters, tabulators, and \\nnew lines. When the text is taken from a web page, it is possible that it \\ncontains several separators placed side by side in a sequence. These kinds of \\nsequences of separators are being replaced by one space character in the \\nprocess of normalization. The process of normalization is performed by the \\nUnitex\\'s external program Normalize. \\nThe second step of post-processing is the process of text tokenization, i.e. \\nbreaking the text up into lexical units. In order to tokenize the text, the Unitex\\'s \\nexternal program Tokenize is called within the class MonitoredText.  \\nThe electronic dictionaries are applied to a text by the Unitex\\'s external \\nprogram Dico. This step provides the possibility to use morphological and \\nlexical filters in search queries. \\nAfter the text is processed in the above described manner, the next step is \\nto search for the patterns described by the user\\'s graph. The search is done \\nby the Unitex\\'s external program Locate, which applies a particular automaton \\nor transducer described by a graph to the text and creates an index of found \\nphrases. The program Locate creates two files: concord.ind with the \\nreferences to occurrences found in the text, and concord.n, with a number \\nof occurrences and a percentage of recognized tokens. These two files are \\nsaved in the working directory, and are used by the sub system for alarming. \\nMethod foundConcordances() of the class MonitoredText uses the file \\nconcord.n to read the number of occurrences of the searched phrases. If \\nthis number is greater than 0, i.e. if the phrases that correspond to the search \\ngraph are found in the text, the method alert() of the class MonitoredText is \\ncalled, and the user is informed about the event. The way of alarming \\ndepends on the values of attributes email and location. The user can \\nchoose to be alerted by an e-mail message, or just to locally save the web \\npage [26].  \\n4. \\nA Use Case \\nThe WebMonitoring software system can be used for different tasks, such as \\npress clipping, detecting spam messages by monitoring electronic mailboxes, \\nmanagement of various documents collections, and so on. We will describe \\none possible use of the WebMonitoring system. \\nA user wishes to find all articles related to the current president of the \\nRepublic of Serbia, Mr. Boris Tadic, which are or will be published in daily \\nnewspapers. The user takes the following steps. \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n14 \\nStep 1. Defining the Event to be Searched for. The event to be searched \\nfor is an occurrence of phrases regarding Mr. Boris Tadic. Some of the \\nphrases (in Serbian language) are: “predsednik Tadić” (“the president Tadic”), \\n“predsednik Srbije” (“the president of Serbia”), “predsednik B. Tadić” (“the \\npresident B. Tadic”), “predsednik Boris Tadić” (“the president Boris Tadic”), \\n“Boris Tadić”, as well as their inflected forms (“predsednika Tadića”, “Borisu \\nTadiću” etc.). \\nStep 2. Describing the Event by a Graph. The user uses Unitex and creates \\na graph that describes the defined event. This task can be performed in many \\ndifferent ways, and it depends on user’s skills and available resources. One \\npossible way of creating the graph is by using morphological filters. An \\nexample is given in the Figure 4. It is necessary to save and compile graph in \\nUnitex, so the file with the extension .fst2 is created. \\n \\nFig. 4. The query automaton \\nStep 3. Choosing the Content to Monitor. The user chooses web pages or \\nweb sites he/she wishes to monitor. Having in mind that the user wishes to \\nfind news articles, he/she chooses official web sites of several daily news \\npapers \\nin \\nSerbia \\n(http://www.danas.rs, \\nhttp://www.blic.rs \\nand \\nhttp://www.politika.rs/Stranice/33.lt.html) as starting points of the monitoring \\nprocess. \\nStep 4. Creating Monitoring Processes in the WebMonitoring System. In \\nthe WebMonitoring system, the user creates a process for each web site \\nhe/she wishes to monitor. For each process the user sets URL, number of \\nlevels for the crawl, location of the graph describing the event, the way of \\nalarming, and the interval for repeating the process. The main window of the \\napplication will appear as shown in the Figure 5. \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n15 \\n \\nFig. 5. Control center with three monitoring processes \\nStep 5. Starting the Processes. The user selects the process in the table \\nshowing processes and starts it by choosing the appropriate button. The \\ncrawling and monitoring process starts and works in the background. The \\nuser can see the progress by choosing the button “Izvestaj” (“Report”). If the \\nphrase that matches the graph is found on some page, the user is alerted \\neither by e-mail or the page is saved locally on the user’s computer. \\n5. \\nResults and Evaluation of the WebMonitoring System \\nThe case described in Section 4 was used to evaluate the WebMonitoring \\nsoftware system. Since we wanted to evaluate both the possibility to process \\ncomplex queries and the possibility to access web content in the short time \\nafter it appears on the web, we conducted the similar searches with two \\nexisting services: GlossaNet, as one of the most powerful, linguistically \\noriented search system, and Google. We had to change some of the search \\nparameters slightly depending on the requirements and the architecture of \\nthese two services, but we tried to keep the search process as uniform as \\npossible. \\nWe monitored two web sites, the official website of the Serbian newspapers \\nBlic (http://www.blic.rs) and a popular forum Krstarica (Cruiser) in Serbian \\nlanguage (http://forum.krstarica.com). Both web sites have a very dynamic \\ncontent that frequently changes. Nevertheless, the Blic web site provides a \\nRSS feed, while Krstarica forum does not. \\nThe results of the evaluation test significantly differ for the two web sites. \\nComparative characteristics of the three systems are presented in Table 1. \\nThe summary of monitoring the Blic web site is given in the Table 2, and the \\nsummary of monitoring the Krstarica forum is given in the Table 3. Since \\nGoogle retrieves documents (web pages) instead of occurrences of the \\nsearched phrases, the number of pages on which the searched phrases are \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n16 \\nfound is given in the Table 2 and 3. The results are further discussed in the \\nfollowing text, and the results from WebMonitoring system are given in \\nAppendix A. \\nTable 1.

The WebMonitoring software system and the GlossaNet \\nservice can process Unitex graphs as search queries, so we used the graph \\ngiven in the Figure 4. On the other hand, Google can process only keyword \\nsearches, so we query Google with: tadić OR \"predsednik tadić\" OR \\n\"predsednik srbije\" OR \"boris tadic\". In that way we were able to \\ncontrol inflectional forms of words with the WebMonitoring and the GlossNet \\nsystems, while we did not have any control, nor the possibility to look for \\ndifferent forms of the same word with Google unless we explicitly put it in the \\nsearch query. In other words, the WebMonitoring and the GlossaNet enable \\nusers to search with complex queries, while Google does not. \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n17 \\nMonitoring a web site. After defining the search queries, it was necessary to \\nset up web sites to monitor. The content of the chosen web sites was used as \\na text corpus to search. The GlossaNet system uses a RSS feed from a web \\nsite as a mechanism for creating and refreshing a text corpus used in a \\nsearch process. A user can choose from a predefined list of websites, or \\ncreate its own corpus, but only for a web site with a RSS feed. After that, the \\nGlossaNet system monitors the chosen site and alerts the user after the \\nmonitoring process is over, sending a message with occurrences found. We \\nchose Blic corpus to be monitored during 24 hours. Since Krstarica forum has \\nnot got a RSS feed, we could not monitor it with the GlossaNet. \\nThe Google system has its own crawling process in which it downloads and \\nindexes the downloaded pages. Many parameters of the Google’s crawling \\nprocess are automated and recalculated during the process, so a user has no \\ncontrol over the process. Therefore, it is necessary for the user to manually \\nquery the Google search system in intervals he/she thinks to be optimal. In \\nour evaluation test, we did two hours check during 24 hours, passing the \\ndescribed search query restricted on the two chosen web sites (adding text \\n“site:blic.rs” and “site:forum.krstarica.com” to the search query). \\nWe also added a 24 hours restriction in order to narrow the search and to \\nachieve a better comparison of results. \\nThe WebMonitoring software system provides the greatest possibilities in \\nterms of setting and controlling the monitoring process. We choose to monitor \\nweb sites http://www.blic.rs and http://forum.krstarica.com, with the crawling \\ndepth set to 3 during the same 24 hours. \\nThe time interval between two visits to the web site content. The \\nGlossaNet system uses a RSS feed from a web site as a mechanism for \\nrefreshing a text corpus used in a search process. The links from RSS feed \\nare visited on a regular basis, but the time period between two visits to links \\nfrom a RSS feed is defined by the GlossaNet system for corpora building and \\ncannot be changed by a user. \\nEach time the Google crawling system crawls a URL, it detects whether the \\nresource has changed since the previous crawl. If the resource changed, the \\nchange interval is shortened. If the resource did not change, the change \\ninterval is lengthened. In that way, a user cannot affect the time interval \\nbetween two visits. In our evaluation test, we monitored web sites with very \\ndynamic content, and since the Google crawls them with high frequency, the \\nrecently added pages from these two web sites were available to Google \\nsearch. The problem arises when monitoring web pages that do not change \\ntheir content in a longer time period, and then suddenly change. \\nThe WebMonitoring software system allows a user to set up the time \\ninterval, depending on his/her expectations. In our evaluation test, we used 30 \\nminutes as a time interval between two crawls. \\nThe content of a web site “visible” to search systems. Given the way the \\nGlossaNet and the Google download pages from a web site, some contents \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n18 \\nremain invisible to them, and therefore to a user. For example, the GlossaNet \\nservice downloaded (and searched) only links provided in the RSS feed. \\nThus, dozens of pages from the Blic web site were not processed. Moreover, \\nKrstarica web site could not be processed at all since it does not provide RSS \\nfeed. Therefore, the GlossaNet system was useless in monitoring process of \\nKrstarica forum web site. \\nIn comparison to Google, the WebMonitoring system processed much less \\npages, but it was expected regarding the architecture of the systems. The \\nGoogle’s crawler and indexing system is far ahead of other crawlers, and we \\nhad no intention to compete with Google in it. The advantage of \\nWebMonitoring over Google is in accessing web content in a short time after it \\nappears on the web. In our evaluation test, Google reported one web page as \\nthe most recent result, giving the time “26 minutes ago”, which would mean \\nthat the page was found by Google at 14:50 (Figure 6). On the other hand, the \\ntime of publishing given on the page was 8:08 AM 29.02.2012. with changes \\nat 8:55 AM (Figure 7). This means that there is a 6 hours time gap from the \\ntime this web page was published on the web to the time Google found it. In \\nour evaluation test, the WebMonitoring system found this page 3 minutes after \\nit was published. In the worst case this time gap can be 30 minutes since the \\nmonitoring process is being repeated every 30 minutes. Moreover, a user can \\nadditionaly reduce the interval, if needed. \\n \\nFig. 6. The most recent Google result: 26 minutes ago (29.2.2012. 14:50) \\n \\nFig. 7. The headline as it appeared on the Blic web site, published at 08:08 AM \\n29.02.2012. \\nSome additional remarks about the WebMonitoring software system are: \\nWebMonitoring Software System: Finite State Machines for Monitoring the Web \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n19 \\n- the WebMonitoring crawling system works with high success; there were no \\nerrors or situations that some web page could not be downloaded; \\n- the recognition of phrases corresponding to the graph is complete, i.e. all \\nphrases that existed in the page content and that correspond to the graph \\nhave been recognized (we used a sample of 30 pages from Blic web site for \\nthis testing); \\n- the speed performance of the system is satisfying having in mind its \\npurpose, although some improvements can be made. This relates primarily \\nto the use of RAM memory instead of saving the changes to the hard disk. \\nUnitex and its external programs record every change of a text on the hard \\ndisk, and this practice was continued in the WebMonitoring system, but it \\nsignificantly slows down the system. Also, the system can be speeded up \\nby using more programming threads. In the current version, one monitoring \\nprocess is executed within one programming thread, while the inside \\noperations of downloading and processing web pages run sequentially; \\n- during monitoring of the web site http://www.blic.rs, the event occurred in \\nmore than 45% of all web pages. The reason for that is not a significant \\nnumber of articles about the president of Serbia, but the design of the site. \\nOn every web page of the web site there is a section with current news, \\nshowing the same news. In the future version of the system this problem \\nshould be solved, i.e. the system must be able to recognize the same \\ncontext on the different pages. \\n6. \\nConclusions \\nThis paper considers the improvement of information search process in terms \\nof making more complex queries and access to content of web pages in a \\nshort period after their posting on the web. As a solution for complex querying, \\nwe suggest using finite state machines. We used finite state machines \\nthrough the software system Unitex for making queries, but also for the post-\\nprocessing of the text. We designed and developed the software system \\ncalled WebMonitoring, which has integrated a subsystem for crawling web \\npages. With such a system users can do their own crawl and search web \\npages they wish, independently from the common search engines. \\nFurthermore, the system WebMonitoring has features that allow user to \\ncreate, maintain and control processes of monitoring web pages or sites. The \\nsystem simulates and automates actions a human would take in the process \\nof looking up for some event (a phrase occurrences) on a page. \\nSince search queries are passed to the system as Unitex graphs, \\nrepresenting finite state automata, this system is not intended for use of a \\ncasual user. A basic understanding of finite state automata is required so a \\nuser could successfully describe a complex context of searched phrases. \\nNevertheless, the Unitex’ graphical user interface for creating and modifying \\ngraphs is user friendly and very intuitive, so any user could easily be trained \\nVesna Pajić, Duško Vitas, Gordana Pavlović Lažetić, and Miloš Pajić \\nComSIS Vol. 10, No. 1, January 2013 \\n20 \\nto use it. Additionaly, the system could be expanded with modules for \\nautomatic transforming regular expressions into Unitex graphs. In that way a \\nuser will be able to choose between regular expressions and graphs, \\ndepending on his/her skills.  \\nThe first version of the WebMonitoring software system should be \\nconsidered as a demonstration how it is possible to integrate lexical word \\nprocessing programs with a concept such as web monitoring. Although the \\ncurrent version of the WebMonitoring software system is fully functional and \\nshows positive effects of applying finite state machines to the search process, \\nit is necessary to make some improvements in future versions of the system.  \\nThese enhancements are primarily related to elimination of possible errors \\nin the code and upgrading performance and speed of the program. In \\naddition, a user should have more control over the process itself in terms of \\nselecting the language or deciding whether or not to apply dictionaries to the \\ntext. The WebMonitoring software system is a general-purpose system. In \\nfuture versions it is possible to modify the system so as to be specialized for \\nspecific types of text (such as medical, technical, etc.), or for special \\npurposes, such as monitoring electronic mailboxes, or search for a specific \\nproduct in a database accessible from the Internet. We expect that these \\nspecialized versions of the WebMonitoring software system will be more \\nefficient. \\nNevertheless, the WebMonitoring software system is important because it \\ndemonstrates a way of overcoming some problems in the process of \\ninformation search. It also gives directions for use of linguistic tools in the \\nsearch process and transcends the limitations in accessing information of the \\nexisting search engines. \\n \\nAcknowledgments.

finite state automata finite state transducers software web monitoring electronic dictionaries web search introduction the problem effective search particular piece information quite current tremendous amount information available the world wide web natural language processing nlp computational linguistics cl play dominant role attempts solve problem depending structure electronic text properties language is written in user requirements nlp cl different levels success although fast powerful search engines already exist are still problems remain unsolved research focused two them first problem invisible web i e access some content web search engines almost every modern vesna paji duko vitas gordana pavlovi laeti milo paji comsis vol no january search system etc consists several sub systems most important sub systems crawling indexing ranking web pages since search systems faced huge number web pages download process subsystem imposes certain limitations search engines crawler find web page necessary either web developer notified system existence web registering the page url search engine crawler visited web page containing hyperlink points it otherwise page remains invisible search system therefore users addition given resources every search system limited crawler certain limitations keep crawling process within limits available resources search engines limit total number pages index and drop old pages new ones others limit frequency repeated visits pages whenever search engine decides limit search process part information remains unavailable users there also time difference moment content uploaded web moment crawler finds it major problem pages frequently change content daily news different forums search engines including google allow author a website reduce interval i e increase frequency crawler visits site order better respond customer requirements another way overcoming problem dynamic content concept rss really simple syndication implies author particular web site edits maintains list changes web site list called rss feed customers interested following changes web site access list automatically using special program known as rss aggregator either case visibility content depends website author author provided rss feed reduced interval crawlers visits page users personally regularly check contents particular website searching specific information the second problem way search engines queries composed which often adequate regardless facts internet users come from different countries different areas interest levels education speak different languages different needs information facing similar forms querying search engines mostly html form keyword search sometimes advanced options allow users limit search way for user formulate complex queries this problem even evident case morphologically rich languages serbian language example users want find web pages serbian national football team would interested

srpski fudbaleri serbian football players srpska ekipa serbian team srpska reprezentacija serbian national team even more documents containing inflectional forms above phrases also relevant user general purpose search engines allow making queries recent years google made significant efforts improve search process bring customers so returns results keywords appear inflected forms well a good attempt improve search big problem users control process in research focused solving above mentioned problems improving way formulating queries allow describing complex context information enabling access content web shortest possible time interval proposed solution uses finite state automata search queries allows users describe complex contexts phrases wish find web pages overcame the second problem designing special system supports concept of monitoring web user full control result have developed software system called webmonitoring works client application users computer crawling sub system that allows user set seed url depth level crawling therefore monitor one page one part web site whole web site users describe information want find graphs representing finite state automata transducers graphs used query search users set way wish alarmed information occurs monitored web page well interval repeated checks state art monitoring web in attempts improve process searching information www different tools searching monitoring web developed depending architecture functionality well problems they focus on divided two groups the tools first group focus monitoring web designed primarily notification web page changed possibility search complex queries except queries based keywords using boolean operators user set frequency downloads often limited minimum interval in cases vesna paji duko vitas gordana pavlovi laeti milo paji comsis vol no january hours interval changes occurring page less hours may not noticed system tools use regular expressions only restrict monitored web page content examples tools online systems website changedetect system online tool monitoring web pages each page user wants monitor possible set several parameters frequency downloads regular expression filtering events causing alerting the user on still minimum monitoring interval hours changes occurring page less hours may noticed the system moreover system designed primarily notification web page changed possibility search complex queries possibility monitor entire site user assign multiple pages monitored control panel monitoring system monitors pages listed url within process website watcher software designed track changes number web pages tool possible monitor formats electronic text including even password protected pages moreover tool allows user monitor changes binary files sense changing size date file changed however even tool support setting complex queries website watcher uses regular expressions restrict monitored web page content user enabled search occurrence keyword phrase the second group available tools contains tools focus making queries search often linguistically oriented one best known webcorp system webcorp software tool designed the department research development english language university birmingham intended primarily linguistic research can used search well user allowed search specific word phrase pattern patterns formed combining operator replaces sequence characters expression square brackets operator although tool represents significant improvement since allows describing complex phrases patterns still solve problem since relies upon results existing search engines therefore still much information web that remains inaccessible tool a free online concordance service glossanet software tool solves many problems related information search web intended search dynamic web corpora users define corpus selecting rss feeds pre selected pool sources glossanet crawler regularly visits sources order generate dynamic corpus user can register one search queries his her dynamic corpus represented finite state automata graphs queries reapplied corpus every time updated new concordances recorded user glossanet greatly improves process search webmonitoring software system finite state machines monitoring web comsis vol no january but main disadvantage way makes corpora glossanet relies upon rss feed therefore upon web sites owner his her decision about updated owner web site provide information change page content user able access information webmonitoring software system theoretical background

entering queries search engines enabling complex searches keyword based ones second problem providing access web page content inaccessible common search engines due search engines crawling limitations

modules originally developed purpose webmonitoring system some rely unitex linguistically oriented software system hereby evaluate webmonitoring system give directions further development keywords finite state automata finite state transducers software web monitoring electronic dictionaries web search introduction the problem effective search particular piece information quite current tremendous amount information available the world wide web natural language processing nlp computational linguistics cl play dominant role attempts solve problem depending structure electronic text properties language is written in user requirements nlp cl different levels success although fast powerful search engines already exist are still problems remain unsolved research focused two them first problem invisible web i e access some content web search engines almost every modern vesna paji duko vitas gordana pavlovi laeti milo paji comsis vol no january search system etc consists several sub systems most important sub systems crawling indexing ranking web pages since search systems faced huge number web pages download process subsystem imposes certain limitations search engines crawler find web page necessary either web developer notified system existence web registering the page url search engine crawler visited web page containing hyperlink points it otherwise page remains invisible search system therefore users addition given resources every search system limited crawler certain limitations keep crawling process within limits available resources search engines limit total number pages index and drop old pages new ones others limit frequency repeated visits pages whenever search engine decides limit search process part information remains unavailable users there also time difference moment content uploaded web moment crawler finds it major problem pages frequently change content daily news different forums search engines including google allow author a website reduce interval i e increase frequency crawler visits site order better respond customer requirements another way overcoming problem dynamic content concept rss really simple syndication implies author particular web site edits maintains list changes web site list called rss feed customers interested following changes web site access list automatically using special program known as rss aggregator either case visibility content depends website author author provided rss feed reduced interval crawlers visits page users personally regularly check contents particular website searching specific information the second problem way search engines queries composed which often adequate regardless facts internet users come from different countries different areas interest levels education speak different languages different needs information facing similar forms querying search engines mostly html form keyword search sometimes advanced options allow users limit search way for user formulate complex queries this problem even evident case morphologically rich languages serbian language example users want find web pages serbian national football team would interested

srpski fudbaleri serbian football players srpska ekipa serbian team srpska reprezentacija serbian national team even more documents containing inflectional forms above phrases also relevant user general purpose search engines allow making queries recent years google made significant efforts improve search process bring customers so returns results keywords appear inflected forms well a good attempt improve search big problem users control process in research focused solving above mentioned problems improving way formulating queries allow describing complex context information enabling access content web shortest possible time interval proposed solution uses finite state automata search queries allows users describe complex contexts phrases wish find web pages overcame the second problem designing special system supports concept of monitoring web user full control result have developed software system called webmonitoring works client application users computer crawling sub system that allows user set seed url depth level crawling therefore monitor one page one part web site whole web site users describe information want find graphs representing finite state automata transducers graphs used query search users set way wish alarmed information occurs monitored web page well interval repeated checks state art monitoring web in attempts improve process searching information www different tools searching monitoring web developed depending architecture functionality well problems they focus on divided two groups the tools first group focus monitoring web designed primarily notification web page changed possibility search complex queries except queries based keywords using boolean operators user set frequency downloads often limited minimum interval in cases vesna paji duko vitas gordana pavlovi laeti milo paji comsis vol no january hours interval changes occurring page less hours may not noticed system tools use regular expressions only restrict

binary files sense changing size date file changed however even tool support setting complex queries website watcher uses regular expressions restrict monitored web page content user enabled search occurrence keyword phrase the second group available tools contains tools focus making queries search often linguistically oriented one best known webcorp system webcorp software tool designed the department research development english language university birmingham intended primarily linguistic research can used search well user allowed search specific word phrase pattern patterns formed combining operator replaces sequence characters expression square brackets operator although tool represents significant improvement since allows describing complex phrases patterns still solve problem since relies upon results existing search engines therefore still much information web that remains inaccessible tool a free online concordance service glossanet software tool solves many problems related information search web intended search dynamic web corpora users define corpus selecting rss feeds pre selected pool sources glossanet crawler regularly visits sources order generate dynamic corpus user can register one search queries his her dynamic corpus represented finite state automata graphs queries reapplied corpus every time updated new concordances recorded user glossanet greatly improves process search webmonitoring software system finite state machines monitoring web comsis vol no january but main disadvantage way makes corpora glossanet relies upon rss feed therefore upon web sites owner his her decision about updated owner web site provide information change page content user able access information webmonitoring software system theoretical background
